# IT_Website

At first we was developed this IT_Website using technologies like React.js + Vite.js and Tailwind CSS, Post CSS, Node Mailer, etc., Next we decided to build a full fledged simple smart data backup for (Backend) using Google Form (Pre-Form Links) to Google Sheets and written App Script Code with should be send an email to the company gmail "careers.synnectify@gmail.com" to notify the admin that is to the particular Job position notification was successfully applied and received at company gmail with a table format which could be look very clean and professional and as the same way user will also get a notification of to which they applied to their particular position from synnectify technologies company gmail "careers.synnectify@gmail.com" to the user gmail will be notify that "your application was successfully submitted to the synnectify technologies".

After we was enhanced this real time project more better way which was AI Calling Agent using 'N8N' of 14 days free trail and we trained our AI Agent to call the users phone number when they submited the Synnectify Job Application, and our AI Calling Agent name is 'Synna AI Calling Agent'
